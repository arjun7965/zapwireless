Clone of Ruckus' Wireless zap tool http://zapwireless.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
"Zap" is a wireless performance tool, previously used for internal development and testing by Ruckus Wireless. 
Ruckus has released the Zap source code under a modified BSD license to provide the tool to the world, 
and hopefully spur development of this and other related analysis tools. Zap measures performance, 
statistically, to provide insight into the true nature of how a network can perform.
